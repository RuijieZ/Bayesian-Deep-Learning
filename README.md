# Bayesian-Deep-Learning

Use PYMC3 and Theano to train a Bayesian Neural Network. In this context it acts in the same way you'd expect any neural net
to behave, except now we can look at standard deviation of the posterior predictive
to get a sense for the uncertainty in our predictions. The uncertainty can be visualized by running:
